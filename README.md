    return render(request, 'bikes.html', context)
Significance: Promotes sustainable transportation. Purpose: Facilitates bike sharing in urban areas. Impact: Reduces carbon footprints and traffic congestion. Usage: Develop an app for users to locate and rent bikes.
6. Elderly Care Reminder App
Code Example: Swift (iOS)
swift


import UIKit

class ReminderViewController: UIViewController {
    // Function to set reminders for medication
    func setReminder(time: Date) {
        // Logic to notify user
    }
}
Significance: Supports elderly independence. Purpose: Reminds users to take medications. Impact: Enhances health management for seniors. Usage: Create a mobile app tailored for elderly users.
7. Disaster Relief Coordination Tool
Code Example: Python with Flask
python


from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

def request_relief():
    # Logic to process relief requests
    return "Relief request submitted!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Significance: Facilitates disaster response. Purpose: Connects those in need with emergency services. Impact: Improves efficiency in disaster management. Usage: Implement in disaster-prone areas for quick access.
8. Environmental Impact Tracker
Code Example: R for Data Analysis
R


library(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("emissions.csv")
ggplot(data, aes(x=Year, y=Emissions)) + geom_line()
Significance: Monitors environmental health. Purpose: Tracks and visualizes emissions data. Impact: Raises awareness about environmental issues. Usage: Provide a dashboard for users to input and view data.
9. Crime Reporting App
Code Example: Java (Android)
java
